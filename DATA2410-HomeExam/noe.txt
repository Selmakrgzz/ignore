As the window size increases from 3 to 5 to 10, you should observe an increase in throughput. This is because a larger window size allows more packets to be in transit at the same time, reducing the idle time and making better use of the network bandwidth. This is particularly effective in networks with high latency, as it allows the protocol to "fill the pipe".
